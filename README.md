Marquee Animation Project
This project demonstrates a fun and simple marquee animation featuring animated GIFs of animals. The animation allows users to interact with it by stopping the movement when they hover over it and resuming when they move the cursor away.

Features
Background Image: The webpage uses a fixed background image (bg.jpg) to enhance its visual appeal.
Marquee Animation:
Scrolls the GIFs of animals (dog, cat, and rat) horizontally across the screen.
Animation pauses when the user hovers over it (onmouseover) and resumes when they move the mouse away (onmouseout).
Custom Speed: The marquee speed is adjusted using the scrollamount attribute.
Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the content.
CSS: To style the background and set animations.
JavaScript (Inline): To control the interactivity of the marquee.
